# Gilded Rose Assessment

The solution has two projects
  1. GildedRose
  2. GildedRoseTests

All the tests can be run and tested from the "GildedRoseTests" Project.

Steps taken to refactor the code.
1. Removed the redundant if else clauses
2. Introduced a separate class for each item
3. Introduced a base class to resue the update method in all item classes
4. Replaced magic strings with constant
5. Created a unit test for each and every scenario mentioned in the requirement
